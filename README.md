# Space Game

![Demo](http://i.imgur.com/xTuMqXF.gif)

A simple C game resembling Space Invaders, made using [termbox](http://github.com/nsf/termbox).

__Note:__ the GIF above is not representative of the smoothness of the game nor my ability to play it :)

### Compiling

Make sure you have [termbox](http://github.com/nsf/termbox) installed first.

```
gcc -ltermbox -lm space.c -o space
```

Or just see the included `run` file.
